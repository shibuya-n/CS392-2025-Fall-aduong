	// 1. Call pg2701_word$strmize() to get a stream of words
	// 2. Then use the RBST implemented in Quiz02_06 to count the number of
	//    occurrences of each word in the stream of words.
	//    Note that you need to modify your Quiz02_06 implementation to turn
	//    it into an generic associative map for this part.
	// 3. Then figure out a way to turn the RBST-based map into a list WNS
	//    (FnList) of word-count pairs
	// 4. Use the mergesort (mergeSort) in Assign05_01 to sort WNS using
	//    the order (w1, n1) <= (w2, n2) if n1 > n2 or n1 = n2 and w1 <= w2
	// 5. The sorted WNS is the return value of pg2701_word$count$listize4()
