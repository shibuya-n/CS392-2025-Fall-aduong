// This question tests your understanding
// of recursion and time analysis involving
// recursion.
// Given a sequence xs, a subsequence of xs
// can be represented as a list of integers
// (representing indices). For instance, given
// xs = "Hello", (0, 2, 4) refers to the subeqence
// "Hlo" (since xs[0] = 'H', xs[2] = 'l', and
// xs[4] = 'o'); (0, 3, 4) also refers to "Hlo".
// The subsequece (0, 2, 4) is to the left of
// the subsequece (0, 3, 4) as (0, 2, 4) is less
// than (0, 3, 4) according to the lexicographic
// ordering.
//
// Here you are asked to implement a function that
// finds the longest leftmost ascending subsequence
// of a given sequence.
// For instance, suppose xs = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4],
// the longest leftmost ascending subsequence of xs
// is represented by (0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8) (which refers
// to [1,2,2,3,3,4] in xs).
//
// In order to receive 50 points, your implementation
// should be quadratic time, that is, O(n^2) time and
// you MUST give a brief explanation as to why it is so.
// Otherwise, a working solution receives at most 60%, that
// is, 30 points out of 50 points.
