<h3>
Programming Assignment 
</h3>

<p>
The Java code for this assignment can be found the subdirectory named <u>Code</u>.
</p>

The Payroll class consists of a set of Employees, stored in the
<em>people</em> variable.  The constructor
will allocate an array of some positive size to <i>people</i>.  
This size is remembered in the private member variable 
<i>maximum_size</i>.  Later, a private member function 
can double the size of the payroll as needed.  (We will not worry about 
decreasing the size of the payroll.)  Only the initial part of the array 
will store actual Employees: you should store the number of actual
Employees in the private variable <i>current_size</i>.<p>

You get to implement the following member functions:
<ol>
<li>
<i>Payroll()</i> -- default constructor; Allocate a payroll of some
positive size (you decide how large) to the people variable, set the
maximum_size appropriately, and the current_size to zero.

<li>
<i>int size();</i> -- return <i>current_size</i>.

<li>
<i>void print();</i> -- print the Employees currently on
the Payroll, one per line.

<li>
<i>void add_employee(Employee newbie);</i> -- add a new Employee to the
payroll, making more room on the payroll if necessary.

<li> 
<i>void remove_employee(int i);</i> -- remove Employee in people[i],
shifting other Employees over to fill its place (or just replacing it with
the last Employee: remove is not guaranteed to keep order).  Throw an
exception if there is no entry at position i.

<li>
<i>int find_employee(String target_name);</i> -- return the first i such
that people[i].name == target_name.  Throw an exception if no such i is
found.

<li>
<i>void copy_payroll(Payroll source);</i> -- assign one Payroll 
to another.

<li>
<i>void add_payroll(Payroll source);</i> -- combine two Payrolls
into one.  Do not worry about repeated items.
</ol>

You may use other private members for Payroll to implement the required
public members if you wish.
<p>

In the file called <em>PayrollTest.java</em>, please write a program that tests
all public member functions of your Payroll class.
<p>

As always, please feel free to ask questions.

<h3>
Grading Criteria
</h3>

<p>Refer to the grading criteria file: <a href="./p1.criteria">p1.criteria</a>
</p>

You are responsible for thoroughly testing your program to make sure that
it works.  Your code must run correctly on csa.  In grading your program,
we will verify that your test cases adequately test your routines, then
test your program on some payroll test files of our own.
<HR>

<h3>
Academic Honesty and Collaboration
</h3>
Cooperation is acceptable in understanding programming concepts and system
features. But the actual solution of the assignments including all
programming must be your individual work.  For example, copying without
attribution any part of someone else's program is plagiarism, even if you
have modified the code.  The University takes acts of cheating and
plagiarism very seriously; first time violators are routinely suspended for
a semester.  <br>&nbsp;
